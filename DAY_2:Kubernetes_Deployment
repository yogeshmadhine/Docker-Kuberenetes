Day 2 - Kubernetes Deployment Log

What I Explored and Learned Today

Understood the concept of Kubernetes and its differences from Docker.

Learned why Kubernetes is used and where it is useful.

Installed Minikube on Windows by downloading the executable and adding it to the system PATH.

Installed kubectl and placed it alongside Minikube for command-line control over Kubernetes.

Verified installation of Minikube and kubectl via command prompt.

Started a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.

Confirmed that Docker image for the Sorting Visualizer was already created and working.

Used the minikube image load command to load the local Docker image into the Minikube cluster.

Created Kubernetes configuration files: deployment.yaml and service.yaml.

Applied the configurations using kubectl apply -f to create the pod and service.

Verified that the pod was running and the service was created.

Used minikube service sorting-visualizer-service to expose the application.

Accessed the Sorting Visualizer in the browser through the Minikube tunnel URL.

Understood that the terminal must remain open while using Minikube tunnel with Docker driver.
